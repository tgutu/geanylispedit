1. Reorganise the directory structure separating source files from the compiled module and installation script.
2. Create downloadable archive containing the compiled module and source files.
3. Write a separate installation script and remove the 'make install' directive. Or maybe not?
4. The plugin currently searches for the VTE terminal in only one location. This is not desirable as people can move the VTE to a sidepane instead.
